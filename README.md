# Fedora post install tasks
Some tasks I usually do after installing Fedora.

### Usage
Git clone the repo or directly download the sh script and run it.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfloc95/Fedora_post_install/main/fedora_post_install.sh
sh fedora_post_install.sh
```
The package **dialog** and sudo priviledges are required. 
The main menu with the task options will be displayed, simply launch the one you want to set. The order is not mandatory, however some tasks require the previous ones (3 requires 1, 5 requires 4). In general I suggest to follow the given order.
